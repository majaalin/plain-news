## Code Reviews
From Oskar Joss
- `index.php:36-49` The foreach loop may be more readable if you first make a list of the different items you would like to print, like $title = article ['title'] etc., and then only print $title in the document itself
- `functions.php:19-20` The usort function was a bit hard to understand. Maybe itâ€™s easier to do like the first example in the PHP documentation
